But now it’s much easier, especially with a link.</p> <h2 id="link-ownership">Link Ownership</h2> <p>For links, you can verify ownership by simply adding <em>&lt;a rel=”me” href=””</em> in your html file, for example I will verify link ownership with fediverse Misskey, as in the following screenshot.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/rel-me-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/rel-me-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/rel-me-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/rel-me.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="hananako main" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>For Misskey itself, the verification process is fast, unlike threads, which can take up to a quarter of an hour.

I last wrote on this website in September, and after that I didn’t write anything else.

Actually, we had many plans to visit historical sites such as Tugu Pahlawan, but due to time constraints and my mother and I suddenly falling ill, we were forced to rest.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/image-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/image-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/image-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/image.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/daun-ungu-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/daun-ungu-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/daun-ungu-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/daun-ungu.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Our first destination at that time was the Al Akbar Grand Mosque, whose location can be found on Google Maps. There were many interesting spots I wanted to visit, but unfortunately we had to pay to enter, so I decided not to go in.</p> <p>The last time I went there was when I was still in first grade. I don’t know if I forgot or what, but some things had changed. Yesterday, I only walked around the park because that was the only part that was free.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/image-2-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/image-2-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/image-2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/image-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/image-3-aaa-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/image-3-aaa-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/image-3-aaa-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/image-3-aaa.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Then the next day, my mother and I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood, combining exercise with a search for food. It was very different from where I live, where everything you need to buy food is very close by. We just walked and found people selling food, unlike in Kediri, where you have to ride a motorcycle just to buy food.</p> <h2 id="finishing-the-funsite-website-project">Finishing the funsite website project</h2> <p>After I returned home and went back to my lodgings, I was confused about what to do, so I decided to work on my fun website project.

The worst part was that I nearly got sick due to the unusually harsh weather.

For commission cases, we need to outsmart them by prompting the client to send 1 USD if they request payment via PayPal.</li> </ol> <h2 id="the-result-of-personal-analysis">The result of personal analysis</h2> <p>After spending the whole day searching for the person behind the name ‘Domian Carlo’ used in various scams such as PayPal, here are the results.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/scam-email-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/scam-email-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/scam-email-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/scam-email.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="start menu" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>It turns out that this name has been most frequently used for scams on various platforms, not only DeviantArt but also Instagram, which has been targeted by scammers.

If people try to google it, the results are minimal, so victims can be confused.</li> <li>Names can be recycled – Scammers often use the same name on multiple platforms (PayPal, DeviantArt, Instagram, email spam) to run automated scripts. If one account gets banned, they create another one with a similar name.</li> <li>The psychological effect of “foreign names” – Many scammers choose international-style names (Spanish, Latin American, European) to appear professional or “foreign,” making them more trustworthy in matters of money or online business.</li> <li>It’s probably just a random generator. There are tools/scripts that generate random fake names, which are then used en masse for thousands of scam accounts. So it’s possible that “Domian Castro” is just a random result, not chosen with any specific intent.</li> </ol> <p>And among the five answers provided by ChatGPT, the most plausible ones are number one and number five, because they appear to be authentic. Number five is only a temporary guess based on the results of a random name generator.</p> <h2 id="characteristics-of-accounts-that-will-scam-you">Characteristics of accounts that will scam you</h2> <p>The social media account was only created two days ago. We don’t need to look far for an example; take Instagram. If a new Instagram account is created, it will be empty, so we fill it with new images, but we use stock images found on the internet or take photos of famous people from their official accounts. What is the purpose of this? It is so that it doesn’t look like a scammer, even though it is obvious that it is a scammer account. Oh yes, for Instagram, we can use Meta AI to report fake or fraudulent accounts, which are usually quickly removed. But what about DeviantArt or Discord?</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/discord-scammer-account-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/discord-scammer-account-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/discord-scammer-account-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/discord-scammer-account.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="start menu" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>It is possible that the process will take a long time and require reports from several users. In the case of vectors, scammers will use vector image profile photos to convince victims, especially those who are opening commissions in the vector category. The reason I have just analyzed is “I have already commissioned A” or other users who offer vector creation services.</p> <h2 id="the-profile-photo-of-the-scammer-was-taken-from-the-internet">The profile photo of the scammer was taken from the internet</h2> <p>The investigation didn’t stop there, so I was curious whether the profile photo used by the perpetrator was his own or taken from the internet. So last night before going to bed, I took the time to ask ChatGPT again to confirm whether the photo was real or belonged to someone else and how to take someone else’s profile photo. It turned out that ChatGPT couldn’t help due to Discord’s own policy, so I had no choice but to use the old method of using the inspect element on the browser.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/discord-inspect-element-derry-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/discord-inspect-element-derry-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/discord-inspect-element-derry-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/discord-inspect-element-derry.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="start menu" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Finally, I logged into my Discord account through my browser and opened the chat account named Derry, then we searched for the user ID in the resource tab. Oh, by the way, we need to know that the Discord account profile photo is located in the cdn.discordapp.com folder in the source, then the avatar, and there will be several folders with numbers. Those numbers are the user IDs. How do we find them? We copy the user ID by right-clicking and pasting it into the search bar to match. Usually, in the source tab, the most recent conversations or those who have just become friends are at the bottom, not the top. After that, I used Google Lens to search for the image used as the profile photo, and yes, my guess was correct it was taken from the internet.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/gambar-asli-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/gambar-asli-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/gambar-asli-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/gambar-asli.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="start menu" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="it-turns-out-that-before-i-worked-on-my-version-of-the-vector-someone-else-had-already-done-it-first">It turns out that before I worked on my version of the vector, someone else had already done it first</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/serupa-tapi-tak-sama-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/serupa-tapi-tak-sama-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/serupa-tapi-tak-sama-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/serupa-tapi-tak-sama.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="start menu" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>So, after I uploaded my version of the vector, it turned out that someone else had already done it, but the caption was rude and the upload date was July 25, 2025.

Soundtrack itu di dalam visual novel nya digunakan pada adegan saat para karakternya sedang menguntit secara diam-diam, entah misi apa yang mereka lakukan. Kamu bisa memainkannya sendiri untuk yang penasaran. Lagu-lagu yang digunakan pada soundtrack dan lagu pembuka disusun dengan sangat unik, dengan mencampurkan musik khas tradisional jepang &amp; remix edm untuk menambah kesan hidupnya sebuah cerita dalam visual novel tersebut. Menurutku ini adalah sebuah ciri khas yang sangat berbeda diantara yang lainnya seperti judul Koi kakeru Shin Ai Kanojo yang masih kesannya terdengar masih serius, sedih dan romantis dalam desain musiknya. ## Latar cerita, dan Teknologi <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/fb_img_17583908993671120314249317427869-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/fb_img_17583908993671120314249317427869-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/fb_img_17583908993671120314249317427869-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/fb_img_17583908993671120314249317427869.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="hananako main" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> Oh, ya aku menyadari dari 2 judul yang aku mainkan, hampir semua disini latar cerita bercerita tentang teknologi masa depan dibalut dengan kemampuan samurainya, teknologi masa depan ini sebenarnya di dunia nyata sudah mau diterapkan. Seperti teknologi pada komputer yang sudah layar sentuh, kacamata untuk komunikasi dan masih banyak lagi apalagi teknologi komunikasi hologram ini juga malah sudah diterapkan loh Oh, ya untuk komposernya kali ini menggandeng lagi dari ALNEAR untuk lagu pembuka, komposer yang sebelumnya juga menggarap visual novel judul milik crystalia sebelumnya. Makin tidak sabar dengan ceritanya bagaimana, sebenarnya aku ingin mengulasnya tapi nanti saja yah, tunggu tanggal mainnya. </p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="game"/><category term="blogging,"/><category term="visual"/><category term="novel"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aku yakin kalian gak asing sama publisher visual novel satu ini, dan salah satu visual novel populernya adalah Kizuna Kirameku Koi Iroha]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sempat frustasi karena masalah driver wifi di Linux</title><link href="https://naturbrilian.github.io/test/pt-br/blog/2025/sempat-frustasi/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sempat frustasi karena masalah driver wifi di Linux"/><published>2025-09-15T21:18:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-15T21:18:16+00:00</updated><id>https://naturbrilian.github.io/test/blog/2025/sempat-frustasi</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://naturbrilian.github.io/test/blog/2025/sempat-frustasi/"><![CDATA[<p>Sempat bingung ketika aku berselancar di internet menggunakan laptopku yang satunya (dulunya aku instal windows 10), tapi baru kali ini aku nemu sebuah masalah setelah memulai ulang laptopku yang terinstal Linux.

CMOS sendiri punya durasi waktu ada yang berumur 2 tahun saja atau 10 tahun, kebetulan CMOS bawaan laptop ini durasinya cukup lama yaitu 10 tahun, jadi wajar jika sudah waktunya diganti (2016 - 2026)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="fixing"/><category term="blogging"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sempat bingung ketika aku berselancar di internet menggunakan laptopku yang satunya (dulunya aku instal windows 10), tapi baru kali ini aku nemu sebuah masalah setelah memulai ulang laptopku yang terinstal Linux.

Previously, I had tried LegatoNowPlaying, but unfortunately, it only supported Misskey, which I strongly disagreed with at the time because there was no Bluesky option.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/test/assets/img/misskey-id-buat-bot-post-480.webp 480w,/test/assets/img/misskey-id-buat-bot-post-800.webp 800w,/test/assets/img/misskey-id-buat-bot-post-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/test/assets/img/misskey-id-buat-bot-post.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="hananako main" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Unfortunately, it turns out that the developer <a href="https://github.com/Legato-Dev/Legato-NowPlaying">LegatoNowPlaying</a> only provides support for one player, namely <a href="https://aimp.ru/">AIMP</a> and in the end I couldn’t use it for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> and etc.</p> <p>Finally, it occurred to me about my account at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scrobble.naturbrilian.dpdns.org">@scrobble.naturbrilian.dpdns.org</a> which I created a few months ago. I actually separated this account from my main account, and it only contains playback statuses.</p> <h2 id="how-do-i-instruct-chatgpt-to-create-a-simple-tool">How do I instruct ChatGPT to create a simple tool?</h2> <p>The way to give commands to chatGPT is very easy. First, I give commands like this, just as if you were chatting with a friend.</p> <pre><code class="language-command">```I have an account on Bluesky with this username: https://bsky.app/profile/namapengguna.bsky.social. I plan to use this account to post what I'm listening to using the Last.fm API. I've tried tools like LegatoNowPlaying from GitHub, but it only works on Misskey. Do you know of any tools or scripts that currently work?
</code></pre> <p>Wait for chatGPT to respond. Usually, chatGPT will respond with recommendations for several tools that you are referring to, but sometimes the answers you receive may not be appropriate. So, try having another conversation as usual, like this I want to automatically post what I’m listening to, not post top artists every week. Or more simply, “not a top artist.” Then ChatGPT will respond with “how to create an autopost Now Playing to Bluesky.” The bot will then create a simple Python script. Just follow the instructions, and the bot will create the full version at the same time.</p> <h2 id="setting-up-your-lastfm-api">Setting up your lastfm API</h2> <p>Get your lastfm API from this <a href="https://www.last.fm/api/account/create">links</a>, then click create, several APIs will appear, then copy the API Key there. http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&amp;user=USERNAME&amp;api_key=APIKEY&amp;format=json&amp;limit=1 Then, copy the code provided by ChatGPT into your favorite text editor.
