Hi, I'm planning to migrate from self-hosted WordPress to my funsite. Although not entirely, the main site hosted on Infinity Free will still be active. There are a few reasons I need to mention here:

<ul>
    <li>I need more advanced features, such as news, portfolio categories and many more features that I need.</li>
    <li>Multi-language support, which in my opinion is less than satisfactory in the official WordPress version and self-hosted version.</li>
</ul>

So, I built a website using tutorials from https://htmlforpeople.com and w3schools. Even though it's static, it's still lightweight and easy to access anywhere and doesn't hog resources. (Thanks to pages.dev.)
