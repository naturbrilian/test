Hi, I'm back again ... it's been a long time since I typed on this personal blog. Yes, as the title might already know what I'm doing as long as I don't type articles on this blog. Of course it is due to activities in the real world, and forced to vacuum in the blogging world. But as long as I don't write on this personal blog, other than real world activities, what do I do?.

## Surely you know the name of the theme customization right?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20200612041059.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

One of them like the picture above, lately I'm interested in the world of skinning / you used to call it theme customization, I took the theme from one of the blogs called "desonime" (you can search this name on Google or Deviantart ).

## Can we make our own theme?
Of course, basically you have to know all the components in the "Windows Style Builder" software, and be preferably experts in using "Photoshop"

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-18-start-menu-narmaya.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This is an example of a theme that I changed the design, but this is still in the working stage.So it's still not perfect.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-21-uh.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Of course, there must be a feeling of resentment ... how not if your theme is going to go into the process of finishing and error. As a result you will repeat from the beginning.
