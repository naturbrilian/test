the last project ?, yaps … like the title of the article I wrote there.
maybe I will resign from this project, yeah because you know it yourself … here I use a data connection.
these five images will be the last project, then will focus on personal projects.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-97.png" title="Yuni Paisen" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

And what is being done now

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-98.png" title="Yuni Paisen" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The five images are under construction, and will be the last project.
That’s all … and thank you for visiting
