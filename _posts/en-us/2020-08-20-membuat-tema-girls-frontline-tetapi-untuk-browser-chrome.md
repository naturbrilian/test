Do you know about this theme? Yes, with the same author

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/gfl-preview-ah-theme.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

In this time, I tried to make it with the same theme. Wait, but not for Windows, Yes, more precisely to complement it.

Here I am trying to make 2 versions, actually I made 3 versions. Because one is for personal use, so I published only 2 versions. Below is an example screenshot:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-25.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-26.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

For the release, I put it on [DeviantArt](http://deviantart.com/gingalibadeidara) account and on one of the my github. So, you can download from my [repository.](https://github.com/naturbrilian/Chrome-Themes)

Oh yeah if you need the Download link for the 404 Squad windows theme: [Girls Frontline 404 Squad Windows 10 Theme by Desonime on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/desonime/art/Girls-Frontline-404-Squad-Windows-10-Theme-847944163)

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-27.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

That's all for the article written because the author can't sleep, good night friends
