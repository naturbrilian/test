Hello, it seems like it's been a long time since I last wrote here (it feels like I just wrote something, lol). As the title suggests, yesterday I was surfing the web about the future of domains and suddenly came across a website called fansubID.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fansub-id-preview.png" title="hananako main" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Yes, it does look a bit heavy because of the effects... but this can be turned off. Here, I'm not talking about the website itself, but rather about the free fansub ID domain provided + you also get a bonus email (e.g., naturbrilian@fansub.id). Now, this subdomain itself isn't used on the Nanako Translation Blog. Initially, Tetsuya had plans to join my subdomain naturbrilian.my.id, but he was confused.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/nanako-tl.png" title="hananako main" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## How to claim a free Subdomain?
Well, actually, the claim is very easy and the configuration is simple. You just need to go to the left sidebar menu > fansub catalog, and you will see a long list of fansubs.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/daftar-fansubs.png" title="hananako main" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Don't have a fansub group yet? Just create one by clicking the add button in the lower right corner. Next, follow the instructions on the site, or via the following link. For the “add blogger” box (box number 2), fill in your blog address (e.g., example.blogspot.com). So this can be an alternative for you if, for example, you are constrained by the cost of buying a domain, you can stay here.
