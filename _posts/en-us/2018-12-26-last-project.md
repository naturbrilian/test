Hello everyone, maybe you have followed my activities on other social media like WhatsApp right?
Yaps ... lately I can't continue the collaboration project because, yes, you will know for yourself right, why?
These two images are the last results I worked on.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20181226014455.jpg" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

and this collab project, the last one I worked on.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20181226014719.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The other is Wip, because the coloring process is by friends.

Thank you for visiting.
