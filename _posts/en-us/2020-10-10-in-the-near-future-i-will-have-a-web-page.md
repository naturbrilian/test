Yes, as the title suggests, because previously I didn't have a website page before, 2 days ago I tried to build a web page, maybe some here already know, at that time i posted it on my twitter account

And the website also has been published on my domain via Google Sites.

Oh, yes, besides that, I'm also still working on vector wallpaper from visitor requests and a karaoke effect project + Indonesian translation
