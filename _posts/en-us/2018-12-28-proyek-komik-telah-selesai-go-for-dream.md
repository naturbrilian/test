Hello how are you, it's been 2 years since I posted on this blog, hahahaha... Maybe you guys have asked, what is the comic project that I have been working on lately with my friends?

Yaps, the title is “Go For Dream”. In the opinion of the blog writer ... the story tells of two men (different majors), liking a woman at the school, her name is Cyntia (yaps Cyntia, not a schoolmate), it turns out that a man likes Cyntia. How it goes, for the comic itself is already available, please read through the following link: www.webtoons.com/id/challenge/go-for-dream/list?title_no=252988
