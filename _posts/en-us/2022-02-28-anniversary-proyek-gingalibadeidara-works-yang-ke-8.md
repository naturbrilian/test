Hello, I'm finally back here. As the title says, I want to tell you how this project started. Initially this project used to be a fad project that started with blogging and started in 2013 when I was still in junior high school.

## BLOGGING
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-55.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The first time I tried blogging on a Japanese blogger platform, let's call it "ameba" at that time just uploaded a random picture and school activities. And in mid 2014 I decided to change the URL due to wrong username setting, stay on the same platform. Then I was confused about how to use the blog platform, so one of my friends on Facebook gave me the easiest blog platform url. The archive post available on this website. kok.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-56.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Deviantart
I used to just make it for fun, I thought "it's better if I create an account so I can save some bookmarks from other users" yep, at first I used that account to look for Naruto fanart, especially from one user named "Goriverde". In 2016 I have started to upload several works starting from design then Line Art and so on.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-57.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Vector project started in 2019 until now. Oh, yes, before that I also made LineArt in one of the software to draw "Paint Tool Sai" in August 2017 to mid 2019.

## Skinning & Themeing
One of the first projects I started was making a Winrar theme, definitely familiar with this one software, and then proceeded to the browser theme.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-58.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-59.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-60.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-61.png" title="start menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Translation Project
Actually, it has been active since 2017, at which time there was a platform that offered users to translate "want the application/software to be in your language" I was very interested, but not long after it was removed from there, finally there was one software that opened a vacancy translation contributor, finally I tried to join with other contributors.

Now it's 8 years old for a fun project, I didn't realize that 2013 wasn't official yet. Now don't know what to do. This is a future video project, and it's not finished yet.
