Yes, I last wrote a post on this blog 8 months ago, which was about "Pensi atau Lanjut. Moreover, I rarely write on the blog not because I'm lazy or what, but I myself don't know what I want to write about, it feels very empty plus I myself am already stressed looking for work here and there, especially since WFH has no test info or what.

Yeah, actually the story above can be a problem where the more I get emotional with one of my favorite games, Princess Connect Re: Dive. This used to be one of my favorite games that I played when I was taking a break at work or if I was really tired. But increasingly here there are factors where I am getting bored to play this game for a long time, the first is that the game content is very boring for a long time, how not usually if there is a time-limited event I am very enthusiastic & why now I am not interested? because, I feel that the limited event is like being repeated (usually we use the term rerun. Secondly, the age factor, yes, please note that I myself am not like I used to be very enthusiastic about playing this game, now I'm not anymore & since there was an update about the system requirements for the device, I've just been really lazy.

## Current game condition
I've actually left it since last July, the last time I joined a guild called “Voyager” (if I remember correctly) and there my account was operated by 2 people, namely me & one of my discord friends. Then what is the current condition of my game? Yes, of course I decided yesterday to delete all game data on my cellphone, but for the dmm version I still have all the data in reserve if at any time dmmgames can be reopened for global access.

## Do you intend to sell it?
Yes, of course there is, but for some reason until now it hasn't sold well, this stupid game. Yasudah, if you want to use it, go ahead, if you want to take it, you are welcome, if not, that's it. That's what I said hehehehe

To be honest, I've made a status like this on Facebook, but I deliberately didn't write long because it's not a blog platform.
