A Designer's job is the same as an Editor's job, who plays a role behind the scenes but a Designer is also the same as an artist, he works and he creates many things. But a Graphic Designer creates art in communicating using text, space, and images. This field is part of visual communication.

The task of a designer is to create something that will be created in the digital world and then realized into the real world. As well as printing banners, posters, t-shirts that are 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional.

Most designers are intangible, only the work is touched but not the person, there are many “designs” that are realized in reality, such as t-shirts, banners, and posters but do not know who designed them and also people who do not know ask who created such a good t-shirt “not the design”.

Like a movie poster ... talking about the movie behind it there are cameramen, directors, scriptwriters, editors and also inside there is a designer who is in charge of designing movie posters, yeeaah even then “a designer gets the back of the screen, only the person but his work appears in front, which appears at the forefront itself, namely the poster design.”

The income of a designer is very expensive, just like an artist the price of his work is very expensive compared to printing, because a designer sells a work from the results of his imagination, mind, and creativity. And that's why the income of a designer is very much.

And what do you think? Are you interested in becoming a designer?

And yeeaah okay just like that it seems that friends definition of a designer.
