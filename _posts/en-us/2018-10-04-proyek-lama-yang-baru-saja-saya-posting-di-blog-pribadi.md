Maybe you still remember my post in 2016? Yaps this time I tried again and this time the picture I made was the result of “tracing”, using the “paint tool sai” software.

## Like this
For example in this picture, and this is a picture of my photo at “Kampung Coklat”

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-9.png" title="hananako main" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

and one of them is one of the anime characters from Anime: Tada-Kun wa koi wo shin'a 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/uuuuu.png" title="hananako main" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I've written all of that before.

Thank you for visiting my blog, see you in the next article
