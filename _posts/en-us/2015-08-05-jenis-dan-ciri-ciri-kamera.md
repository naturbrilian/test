Okay, you understand what photography is, which I have explained in the previous article entitled ["Definition of Typography"](http://multimediaduasmkti.blogspot.com/2015/08/definisi-fotografi.html) Yes, okay, next I will explain the types of cameras for photography activities.

There are many types of cameras used for photography activities, namely Pocket Camera / Digital Pocket Camera, SLR (Single Lens Reflex) Camera and also DSLR Cameras (Digital Single Lens Reflex) well among the types of cameras that are very popular for Photography activities.

Let me first explain the meaning of camera.

The camera is the most popular tool for the activity of Photography, this tool which comes from the Latin ebscura for “dark room” an early mechanism for projecting a view in which a room functions like how a modern photographic camera works, except there was no way at that time to record the appearance of the image other than manually following the trail.

In the world of photography, a camera is a device for forming and recording a portrait image on a sheet of film. In television cameras, the lens system forms an image on a light-sensitive plate. This plate will emit electrons to the target plate when exposed to light.

So the camera is not just for selfies in front of the camera, but the camera is also for producing work in the world of graphics by taking pictures / photographing images using a camera.

Okay, now I will explain the types and characteristics of the cameras that I mentioned earlier.

# 1. Digital Pocket Camera

    </div>

Pockets cameras are one of the types of photography cameras that are easy to carry around and use a form of digital data storage and image capture with a small size. This is the purpose of the camera which is designed to be as practical and automatic as possible. As the name implies, pocket cameras have a shape and size that fits in a shirt or pants pocket. The above is one of the advantages of pocket cameras. But what needs to be known for compact cameras in general is the limitation to be professionally creative, and the monotonous and simple photo functions.

# 2 . SLR (Single Lens Reflex) Camera

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/slr.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

SLR cameras are types of professional photography cameras that still use film or cliché as a manual image capture medium. By using a fixed lens or zoom lens, SLR cameras can capture images with very high resolution and detail.

# 3 . DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) Camera

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/dslr.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

There are many advantages that can be talked about if you want to dig deeper into information about digital cameras. Various functions are provided to get good and quality photo images. SLR digital cameras are cameras for professional classes that require photos with super high resolution. Unlike SLR cameras, one of these types of photographic cameras upgrades the image capture sensor with an electronic device called a CCD / CCD sensor. There are also those that use CMOS sensors.

well maybe like that, the types of cameras used for photography activities, okay thank you friends for visiting and hopefully it is useful for all of you.
