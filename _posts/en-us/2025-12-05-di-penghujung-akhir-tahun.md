It feels like 2025 is coming to an end. I last wrote on this website in September, and after that I didn't write anything else. On the one hand, I also learned how to make my own website, which was quite fun.

## Enjoying the atmosphere of Surabaya for 1 week
Last November, when I had no activities, even though I was still working remotely, my family and I spent my vacation in Surabaya. Actually, we had many plans to visit historical sites such as Tugu Pahlawan, but due to time constraints and my mother and I suddenly falling ill, we were forced to rest.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/daun-ungu.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Our first destination at that time was the Al Akbar Grand Mosque, whose location can be found on Google Maps. There were many interesting spots I wanted to visit, but unfortunately we had to pay to enter, so I decided not to go in.

The last time I went there was when I was still in first grade. I don't know if I forgot or what, but some things had changed. Yesterday, I only walked around the park because that was the only part that was free.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-3-aaa.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Then the next day, my mother and I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood, combining exercise with a search for food. It was very different from where I live, where everything you need to buy food is very close by. We just walked and found people selling food, unlike in Kediri, where you have to ride a motorcycle just to buy food.

## Finishing the funsite website project
After I returned home and went back to my lodgings, I was confused about what to do, so I decided to work on my fun website project. I felt that using AI to create it would be less exciting, so I learned from the website https://htmlforpeople.com/ with a few adjustments.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-4.png" title="hananako main" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

My week there was actually both fun and not so fun. The worst part was that I nearly got sick due to the unusually harsh weather. What should have been cold was actually hot during the rainy season; sometimes the weather was hot and I felt cold.

That's all for this post.
