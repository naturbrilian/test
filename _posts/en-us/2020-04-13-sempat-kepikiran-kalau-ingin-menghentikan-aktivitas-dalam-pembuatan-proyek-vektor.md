Hello, I'm back. I thought it's been a while since I updated this blog. Oh, and I apologize in advance, as I also manage the Indonesian version of the blog. I also make tutorials, but unfortunately, they're long videos.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-12.png" title="Yuni Paisen" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

You can see this vector creation tutorial via the following link, or

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mjbc3DS50SQ?si=fOp6niSVNt_jbzQL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before I want to stop vector creation activities for a very silly reason, maybe some readers still remember this tweet that made me want to stop vector creation at that time.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-13.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-14.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Well, in reality, this project is still ongoing but I'm lazy, but I myself rarely make designs in this style & now I'm more focused on translation projects in my spare time.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image-156.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Actually, I don't want to retire, but perhaps it's more accurate to say that I've entered a period where I'm bored of doing things like this, lol~
